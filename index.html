            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>I'm Eric Wang, a rising sophemore in Vestavia Hills, Alabama.I love everything math-related, and enjoy programming in my free time.</p>
            <p>I'm currently the VP of the <a href="https://www.birminghammathclub.org/">Alabama Youth Math Club</a>, an independent nonprofit dedicated to fostering interest in mathematics, supporting local communities, and support STEM education.
            </p>
            <p>I also enjoy problem writing for both <a href="https://aops.com">AoPS</a> Mocks like <a href="https://benny-w.github.io/ZeMC/">ZeMC</a> and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community/c594864h3000448">TLMC</a> as well as local  tournament tests, particularly for my middle school and high school math tournaments. 
            </p> 
            <p>My problem stash of most of the problems I've written will be eventually hosted here, at least starting from 2026. 
            </p>

            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>So, what's this for?
            <ul>
                <li>Hopefully, to store Olympiad write ups for <a href="https://web.evanchen.cc/otis.html">OTIS</a> and maybe for <a href="https://bookstore.ams.org/prb-27">EGMO</a> as well.</li>
                <li>To write some stuff as a coping technique, or just rant about life.</li>
                <li>To serve as a hosting platform for any future projects that pique my interest.</li>
                <li>Apart from that, no idea, I was just bored so I made this.</li>
            </ul>
